# DWAP is Decentralised Web Application
A new form of application that is Decentralised, Cross Platform and Self Hosted


* Decentralized - DWAP reprents web application that is distributed in the form of a file. People could use any existing way to get it, from P2P network, Cloud disk like Dropbox or even as an attachment of email. No single centrol point to block it. 

* Cross Platform - DWAP file can be opened in Window, Mac and Linux. More platform support are coming soon!

* Self Hosted - All files needed can be embeded in one DWAP file. It can even run without an internet connection.

# How to use?

1. Create an empty folder, like abc/, and put html files, js, css and other needed files inside the folder. Make sure to have abc/index.html, as it will be treated as home page.

2. zip all files in folder into a zip file, like abc.zip (note, don't zip abc/ folder itself, just files and subfolders).

3. rename abc.zip to abc.dwap

4. use dwap/dwap.exe to run abc.dwap . On MacOS, once dwapView got installed, .dwap file can run by double click on it. 

# Best practice

It may be easier for user to use to create a zip file which has .dwap file, dwap.exe, dwapView.dmg and a readme files inside.
